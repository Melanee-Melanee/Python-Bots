# Each step is going to be a new prompt for next steps.


## First Step: chatbot, text generation 
This step is an implementation of a simple chatbot using TensorFlow, which is a machine learning framework developed by Google. The chatbot is trained using a neural network to classify user inputs into predefined intents and provide appropriate responses based on the detected intent.
The intents.json file is the data that we will provide to our chatbot.
